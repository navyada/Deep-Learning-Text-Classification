# Deep-Learning-Text-Classification

This project uses positive and negative movie reviews to build the following classifiers: multi-layer perceptron, one-dimensional convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory recurrent neural network. I used Tensorflow and Keras to preprocess the text files and to build the models. The LSTM neural network had the highest test accuracy, but took the longest to run.
